# FantaSanremo

The Sanremo Festival is becoming increasingly social. And so, companies and content creators are also following the events of the festival to stay up-to-date on possible trends to exploit and opportunities to grow. In recent years, "FantaSanremo" - a game that involves viewers but also in competing singers - has been popular among young and old.

This project focuses on analyzing tweets related to the #FantaSanremo 2023 edition, and aims to analyze content, the most relevant hashtags, and sentiment related to the topic of interest.

## About

Next, sentiment analysis of the tweets was performed.
